start
initalize the variables a and b
initalize gcd =1 
if a<b 
checking  a < b is smaller
 take a loop i start from 1 to a
 check the i is divided by a and b with out any remainde
 then a and b are divisible by i the update gcd value as i
if b<a
take a loop i start from 1 to a
 check the i is divided by a and b with out any remainde
 then a and b are divisible by i the update gcd value as i
 calculate the lcm value 
 print the GCd value
print the lcd value
