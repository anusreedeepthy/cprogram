1. Create a C program that defines a function to increment an integer by 1. The function should demonstrate call by value, showing that the original value remains unchanged.
 
2. Write a C program that attempts to swap two integers using a function that employs call by value. Show that the original values remain unchanged after the function call.
 
3. Develop a C program that calculates the factorial of a number using call by value.
 
4. Create a C program that defines a function to find the maximum of two numbers using call by value.
