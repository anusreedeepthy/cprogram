Assignment 1: Constant Variable Declaration

Objective: Learn to declare and initialize constant variables.

Write a program that declares a constant integer variable for the value of Pi (3.14) and prints it. Ensure that any attempt to modify this variable results in a compile-time error.
 
Assignment 2: Using const with Pointers

Objective: Understand how to use const with pointers to prevent modification of pointed values.

Create a program that uses a pointer to a constant integer. Attempt to modify the value through the pointer and observe the compiler's response.
 
Assignment 3: Constant Pointer

Objective: Learn about constant pointers and their usage.

Write a program that declares a constant pointer to an integer and demonstrates that you cannot change the address stored in the pointer.
 
Assignment 4: Constant Pointer to Constant Value

Objective: Combine both constant pointers and constant values.

Create a program that declares a constant pointer to a constant integer. Demonstrate that neither the pointer nor the value it points to can be changed.
 
Assignment 5: Using const in Function Parameters

Objective: Understand how to use const with function parameters.

Write a function that takes a constant integer as an argument and prints its value. Attempting to modify this parameter inside the function should result in an error.
 
 
Assignment 6: Array of Constants

Objective: Learn how to declare and use arrays with const.

Create an array of constants representing days of the week. Print each day using a loop, ensuring that no modifications can be made to the array elements.
 
 
Assignment 7: Constant Expressions

Objective: Understand how constants can be used in expressions.

Write a program that uses constants in calculations, such as calculating the area of a circle using const.
 
Assignment 8: Constant Variables in Loops

Objective: Learn how constants can be used within loops for fixed iterations.

Create a program that uses a constant variable to define the number of iterations in a loop, ensuring it cannot be modified during execution.
 
Assignment 9: Constant Global Variables

Objective: Explore global constants and their accessibility across functions.

Write a program that declares a global constant variable and accesses it from multiple functions without modifying its value.
