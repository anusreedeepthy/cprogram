// Problem Statement 4: Weather Data Analysis
 
// Description: Write a program that collects daily temperature data for a month and analyzes it to find the average temperature, the highest temperature, the lowest temperature, and how many days were above average.
 
// Requirements:

// 1. Use appropriate data types (float for temperatures and int for days).

// 2. Store temperature data in an array.

// 3. Use control statements to calculate:

// 	i.   Average Temperature of the month.

// 	ii.  Highest Temperature recorded.

// 	iii. Lowest Temperature recorded.

// 	iv.  Count of days with temperatures above average.

// 4. Handle cases where no data is entered.
 
// Example Input/Output:

// Enter temperatures for each day of the month (30 days):

// Day 1 temperature: 72.5 

// Day 2 temperature: 68.0 

// ...

// Day 30 temperature: 75.0
 
// Average Temperature of Month: XX.X 

// Highest Temperature Recorded: YY.Y 

// Lowest Temperature Recorded: ZZ.Z 

// Number of Days Above Average Temperature: N
